# RoboConContest
This code draws the winners of RoboCon 2021 Contest


## Transparency
We want to be totally transparent.
Therefore, we publish this repository so that you can see how ugly the robot code is, that does this trick for us.

The only encrypted/secret information here are the API-Keys to the Google Sheet that contains the submitted answers
and the actual correct answer of the contest.

## Disclaimer
This code is not meant to be a good example how to code and it is here for fun and transparency.

There are some people excluded from the draw. These are basically the members of RoboCon Event Orga Team.

However, the actual secret is only known by Mateusz Nojek and René Rohner.

### C U Soon and be excellent to each other!
Mateusz and René
