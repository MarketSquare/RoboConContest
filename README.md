# RoboConContest
This code draws the winners of RoboCon Contest 2021


## Transparency
We want to be totally transparent.
Therefore we publish this repository so that you can see how ugly the robot code is, that does this trick for us.

The only encrypted/secret information here are the API-Keys to the google sheet that contains the submitted answers,
the actual correct answer.

## Disclaumer
This code is not meant to be a good example how to code and it is here for fun and transparency.

There are some people excluded from the draw. These are basically the RoboCon Event Orga Team.

However the actual secret is only known by Matheusz Nojek and René Rohner.

### C U Soon and be exelent to each other!
Matheusz and René
